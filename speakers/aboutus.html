    <h1><s>About</s>Among Us</h1>
    <p>
        I started playing among us recently, and I think my son might be imposter??? <br>
        I recently downloaded among us, and it made me realize my son is super sussy. <br>
        For starters the other day I told him to set the table, and he didn't (not completing tasks). <br>
        Secondly he dropped his phone in a puddle recently, and it broke (sabotaged comms). Should I eject him from my household? <br>
        For reference, he is 8. Let me know in the comments reddit, and I'll call an emergency meeting right away! <br></p>
