    <h1>League of Legends support ticket</h1>
    <p>I got permabanned for inappropriate chat language. I've spent lots of money (700$) and lots of time on my account.
        I would be very grateful if you could replace my permaban for a chat ban or something else or at least a partial refund.
        I've spent a lot of time and money on my account I would greatly appreciate a slightly less punishment.
        I am totally fine with my next ban -- a permanent if need be. The chat logs I was banned for were nothing I would've heard in a normal game.
        I used 0 slurs and minor cussing. definitely not worth a permaban.</p>
