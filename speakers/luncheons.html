  <h1>Steamed Hams</h1>
  <p>Well Seymour, I made it, despite your directions... Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome! I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!

      <br>Eh... (gasp)

      <br>Oh, egads! My roast is ruined!

      <br>But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ohohoho, delightfully devilish, Seymour!

      <br>Ah–

      <br>[theme song intro]

      <br>Skinner, with his crazy explanations, the superintendent's gonna need his medication. When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations, there'll be trouble in town tonight!

      <br><b>SEEEEEEYMOOOOOOUR!</b>

      <br>Superintendent, I was just, uh... just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise! Care to join me?

      <br>Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?

      <br>Uh– ooh, that isn't smoke, it's steam, steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmm, steamed clams!

      <br><i>Whew!</i>

      <br>Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers! I thought we were having steamed clams... D'oh, no, I said "steamed hams". That's what I call hamburgers.

      <br>You call hamburgers steamed hams?

      <br>Yes! It's a regional dialect.

      <br>Uh-huh. Er, what region?

      <br>Uhhhhh upstate New York.

      <br>Really? Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams".

      <br>Oh, not in Utica, no, it's an Albany expression.

      <br>I see.

      <br>You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.

      <br>Ohohoho, no! Patented Skinner-burgers! Oooooold family recipe!

      <br>...For steamed hams.

      <br>Yes!

      <br>Yes, and you call them steamed hams, despite the fact they are obviously grilled.

      <br>Yeah eh– You know, th– One thing I sh– ...

      <br>'Scuse me for one second. Of course.

      <br>[exaggerated yawn]

      <br>Well, that was wonderful! Good time was had by all, I'm pooped!

      <br>Yes, I should be– GOOD LORD, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?

      <br>Aurora Borealis.

      <br>Uh–

      <br>AURORA BOREALIS. At THIS time of year, at THIS time of day, in THIS part of the country, localized ENTIRELY within your kitchen?

      <br>Yes!

      <br>May I see it?

      <br>...No.

      <br>SEYMOUR, THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE!

      <br>No, mother, it's just the Northern Lights!

      <br>Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say... ...you steam a good ham.

      <br>HEEEEEELP! HEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!
