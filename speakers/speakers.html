  <p>See, they didn't specify what was <i>in</i> the speaker file, but they said we needed to put their links anyway so might as well be a little silly about it, I suppose.</p>

  <blockquote>A <b>copypasta</b> is <b>a block of text that is copied and pasted across the Internet by individuals through online forums and social networking websites.</b>
    Copypastas are said to be similar to spam as they are often used to annoy other users and disrupt online discourse.
    The term “copypasta” is said to have emerged from 4chan forums around 2006. Here, copypasta was originally used to mock or provoke new users, who generally respond negatively to it.</blockquote>
